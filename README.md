# Air Hockeyüèë Reinforcement Learning:robot:
This is a classic air hockey game built using PyGame, where two AI agents compete through Reinforcement Learning powered by PyTorch. Experience the excitement of virtual air hockey, customize hyperparameters like learning rates and rewards, and track AI progress with training analytics. Easy to set up, this repository offers a glimpse of AI-driven air hockey battles. 
I have built another repo as well where an agent plays Atari Breakout game..Do check that out too :grin::grin:
